In US terms, it is simply the standings. All 18 teams in the league are lumped together (no divisions or conferences) and each team is ranked by the number of points they’ve won throughout the season. A team gets 4 points for a win, 2 points for a tie/draw and 0 points for a loss. The top 8 teams after a 22 game season will get a chance to play in the finals. It is a fairly straightforward concept, so why dedicate an entire post to it?\nWell beyond the interesting, and frankly much more descriptive term to denote rankings, I want to use this as an opportunity to look at how teams have done on a season by season basis. I want to know, How many points does a team typically need to shoot for to end up top of the ladder? What about at the other end? How does a team’s quality persist year to year? Do we have any dynasties? What about laughingstocks of the league?\nThis will be another fairly simplistic analytics post, but I once again think it is a great way to introduce data exploration for the true beginner. I truly do not know these answers. I lack the personal, cultural osmosis by which something like this might seep into my subconscious. So if you want to learn a little more about the above questions, let’s dig into the data and start unearthing some answers.\n\n# Replace these placeholders with your actual PostgreSQL credentials\ndb_host <- \"localhost\"\ndb_name <- \"AFL_data\"\ndb_user <- \"postgres\"\ndb_password <- \"Cincinnati1\"\n\n# Construct the connection string\ncon_string <- paste0(\"host=\", db_host,\n                     \" dbname=\", db_name,\n                     \" user=\", db_user,\n                     \" password=\", db_password)\n\n# Establish the connection\ncon <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), dbname = db_name, user = db_user,\n                 password = db_password, host = db_host)\n\n# Years range (update this based on your data)\nstart_year <- 2015\nend_year <- 2022\n\n# Create an empty list to store data frames\ndata_list <- list()\n\n# Loop through each year\nfor (year in start_year:end_year) {\n  # Generate the table name for the specific year\n  table_name <- paste0(\"afl_results_\", year)\n  \n  # Fetch data from the table for the current year\n  query <- paste0(\"SELECT * FROM \", table_name)\n  data <- dbGetQuery(con, query)\n  \n  # Append the data to the list\n  data_list[[year - start_year + 1]] <- data\n}\n\n# Combine data into one data frame\nafl_results <- do.call(rbind, data_list)\n\n\n\n\n# Years range (update this based on your data)\nstart_year <- 2011\nend_year <- 2022\n\n\n# Create an empty list to store data frames\ndata_ladder <- list()\n\n# Loop through each year\nfor (year in start_year:end_year) {\n  # Generate the table name for the specific year\n  table_name <- paste0(\"afl_ladder_squiggle_\", year)\n  \n  # Fetch data from the table for the current year\n  query <- paste0(\"SELECT * FROM \", table_name)\n  data <- dbGetQuery(con, query)\n  data$year<-year\n  # Append the data to the list\n  data_ladder[[year - start_year + 1]] <- data\n}\n\n# Combine data into one data frame\nafl_ladder <- do.call(rbind, data_ladder)\n\n\nThe Ladder - 2022\nLet’s start by taking a look at the final results for a single year. Below is a table for the 2022 season ordered from top to bottom. We can see the champion Geelong Cats put up 72 points with an 18-4 W/L record. The entire season only recorded a single draw between Fremantle and Richmond. Finally, our wooden spoon winner (the bottom of the table) was split between West Coast and North Melbourne with a measly 8 points; only 2 wins on the entire season! A 2-20 season is pretty dire, but let’s look across seasons to see how this compares to other years\n\nAFL_logos<-read.csv(\"AFL_logos.csv\")\n\nladder_2022<-afl_ladder%>%filter(year==2022)%>%left_join(AFL_logos,by=c('name'='Team_Name'))%>%select(rank,name,logo,played,pts,wins,losses,draws)\n\nladder_2022%>%gt()%>%gt_img_rows(columns=logo)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      rank\n      name\n      logo\n      played\n      pts\n      wins\n      losses\n      draws\n    \n  \n  \n    1\nGeelong\n\n22\n72\n18\n4\n0\n    2\nMelbourne\n\n22\n64\n16\n6\n0\n    3\nSydney\n\n22\n64\n16\n6\n0\n    4\nCollingwood\n\n22\n64\n16\n6\n0\n    5\nFremantle\n\n22\n62\n15\n6\n1\n    6\nBrisbane Lions\n\n22\n60\n15\n7\n0\n    7\nRichmond\n\n22\n54\n13\n8\n1\n    8\nWestern Bulldogs\n\n22\n48\n12\n10\n0\n    9\nCarlton\n\n22\n48\n12\n10\n0\n    10\nSt Kilda\n\n22\n44\n11\n11\n0\n    11\nPort Adelaide\n\n22\n40\n10\n12\n0\n    12\nGold Coast\n\n22\n40\n10\n12\n0\n    13\nHawthorn\n\n22\n32\n8\n14\n0\n    14\nAdelaide\n\n22\n32\n8\n14\n0\n    15\nEssendon\n\n22\n28\n7\n15\n0\n    16\nGreater Western Sydney\n\n22\n24\n6\n16\n0\n    17\nWest Coast\n\n22\n8\n2\n20\n0\n    18\nNorth Melbourne\n\n22\n8\n2\n20\n0\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nNow let’s look at a list of some prior AFL ladder leaders. Please note, these aren’t the champions of the AFL premiership. Instead, that is decided by an 8 team playoff that has an interesting knockout structure that I will go into more deeply in another post. Instead, let’s just focus on the ladder during the “regular” season. I will go back to 2011/2012 since those seasons saw the league expand to 17 and then 18 teams with the introduction of the Gold Coast Suns and the Greater Western Sydney Giants.\nLooking at the Ladder leaders, we Geelong, Sydney and Hawthorne with 2 top finishes in 3 year spans, suggesting teams go through a mini-period of dominance, but we don’t see any one team dominate. Excluding the COVID year (2020) this suggests teams need to shoot for high 60s/low 70s for points to lead the ladder at season end, which means wining roughly 75% of your games.\n\nchamps<-afl_ladder%>%filter(rank==1)%>%left_join(AFL_logos,by=c('name'='Team_Name'))%>%select(year,rank,name,logo,played,pts,wins,losses,draws)%>%arrange(desc(year))\n\nchamps%>%gt()%>%gt_img_rows(columns=logo)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      year\n      rank\n      name\n      logo\n      played\n      pts\n      wins\n      losses\n      draws\n    \n  \n  \n    2022\n1\nGeelong\n\n22\n72\n18\n4\n0\n    2021\n1\nMelbourne\n\n22\n70\n17\n4\n1\n    2020\n1\nPort Adelaide\n\n17\n56\n14\n3\n0\n    2019\n1\nGeelong\n\n22\n64\n16\n6\n0\n    2018\n1\nRichmond\n\n22\n72\n18\n4\n0\n    2017\n1\nAdelaide\n\n22\n62\n15\n6\n1\n    2016\n1\nSydney\n\n22\n68\n17\n5\n0\n    2015\n1\nFremantle\n\n22\n68\n17\n5\n0\n    2014\n1\nSydney\n\n22\n68\n17\n5\n0\n    2013\n1\nHawthorn\n\n22\n76\n19\n3\n0\n    2012\n1\nHawthorn\n\n22\n68\n17\n5\n0\n    2011\n1\nCollingwood\n\n22\n80\n20\n2\n0\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nOn the other end of the table, we see some similar streakiness with back-to-back wooden spoons (the “award” for last place) for North Melbourne and GWS Giants and 2 in 4 years for Carlton.

We do see a pretty stark difference between the two clubs with North Melbourne finishing above Geelong only once. Like American sports, we just see some organizations are better at being consistent contenders than others.\n\ntwo_team<-afl_ladder%>%filter(name==\"Geelong\"|name==\"North Melbourne\")%>%left_join(AFL_logos,by=c('name'='Team_Name'))\n                                                              \nwide_data <- two_team %>%select(name,rank,year,logo)%>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = name, values_from = c(rank,logo))\n\n# Create the plot with separate lines for each team\nggplot(wide_data, aes(x = year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = `rank_North Melbourne`), color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_line(aes(y = rank_Geelong), color = \"gray\") +\n  geom_point(data = two_team, aes(x = year, y = rank)) +\n  geom_image(data = two_team, aes(x = year, y = rank, image = logo), size = 0.1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(two_team$year)) +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks = seq(1, 18, 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Team Rank Year by Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Rank\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nOne measure of stability is to look at the correlation between the prior year rank to the current year rank. A correlation close to 1 suggests year to year correlation has a positive relationship. If you were good you are likely good next year and vice versa. With this data, we observe a 0.567 correlation which is a pretty strong positive correlation. This means team quality won’t very much at least on a year to year time frame. If we did this for say a three year window we would expect a weaker correlation.\n\n# Sort the original data by team and year\nrank_df <- afl_ladder %>%\n  select(name,year,rank)%>%\n  arrange(name, year)\n\n# Add the rank from the prior year for each team\nrank_corr <- rank_df %>%\n  group_by(name) %>%\n  mutate(rank_year_prior = lag(rank))\n\n# If you want to remove the rows where there is no prior year data (for the first year of each team)\nrank_corr <- rank_corr %>% \n  filter(!is.na(rank_year_prior))\n\n\ncor(rank_corr$rank,rank_corr$rank_year_prior)\n\n[1] 0.5657122\n\n\nTo close, we can take a look at each team’s performance of the last 11 years and summarize it using a boxplot to see where the teams roughly tend to fall. We can learn which teams have typically been good or poor in the past decade and which teams occupy the middle class of the AFL. For example, Western Bulldogs have been solidly average with an average rank right around 8 and their best finish is 5th and their worst is 15th. Gold Coast is bad. Geelong and Sydney tend to be good. Most teams though have seen a wide variety of outcomes season to season as they go through up and down periods.\n\nall_ladder<-afl_ladder%>%left_join(AFL_logos,by=c('name'='Team_Name'))%>%select(rank,name,logo,played,pts,wins,losses,draws)\n\nsuppressWarnings({\n  ggplot(all_ladder, aes(x = name, y = rank,color=as.factor(name))) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_discrete() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(title = \"AFL Team Ranks 2011-2022\") + coord_flip()\n})"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Learning about AFL positional play through statistics\n\nPlease note the data I use in this analysis is from the 2022 season courtesy of the fitzRoy package. Many of the definitions and information come thanks to Wikipedia.\nThe goal of this post is going to be to help an absolute novice to the sport (me) understand some of the basic counting statistics in the game and how certain positions do in those counting statistics. For instance, does a Ruck Rover typically lead the team in goals or a Full Forward? How many tackles should we expect from our full-back? This post will help answer these basic questions by looking at data from the 2022 season and plotting the per game major statistics for each position.\nBefore diving into the data, let’s start with the basics of what I know to this point. Each team has 22 players, 18 of which are on the field at each time. An AFL field takes an oval shape and according to Wikipedia for professional levels the area of play is “typically between 135–185 metres (148–202 yd) long goal-to-goal and 110–155 metres (120–170 yd) wide wing-to-wing”. So we have a massive playing area much larger than a soccer pitch of NFL field on which 18 players per team are attempting to get the ball through the goal posts at either end. Unlike football (soccer) there doesn’t seem to be any concept of offsides, so these players can be really anywhere on the field during the course of play. This freedom and size seems to be really intriguing from a strategic perspective as one could configure their play in a variety of ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at what positions we have in the data. It seems that we have 20 unique position codes using abbreviations. Below is a table that gives an example of what we see. Given I don’t have the knowledge to interpret these abbreviations I will have to go outside the data set to try and make some type of key to the full name for each position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      position\n    \n  \n  \n    SUB\n    INT\n    HBFR\n    FF\n    FPL\n    BPL\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nLet’s breakdown these positions similar to how we’d break down football (soccer) positions on the pitch; attack, midfield and defense. In attack we have 6 players, midfield we have 6 players and defense we have 6 players. The position names are listed in the table and the associated graph shows roughly where they play on the oval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Position_Abbrev\n      Position.Name\n      Position.Type\n    \n  \n  \n    SUB\nSubstitute\nBench\n    INT\nInterchange\nBench\n    HBFR\nHalf-Back Flank Right\nDefender\n    BPL\nBack Pocket Left\nDefender\n    FB\nFull Back\nDefender\n    BPR\nBack Pocket Right\nDefender\n    HBFL\nHalf-Back Flank Left\nDefender\n    CHB\nCenter Half Back\nDefender\n    FF\nFull Forward\nForward\n    FPL\nForward Pocket Left\nForward\n    HFFR\nHalf-Forward Flank\nForward\n    FPR\nForward Pocket Right\nForward\n    HFFL\nHalf-Forward Flank Left\nForward\n    CHF\nCenter Half Forward\nForward\n    WL\nLeft Wing\nMidfield\n    WR\nRight Wing\nMidfield\n    RR\nRuck Rover\nMidfield\n    C\nCenter\nMidfield\n    R\nRover\nMidfield\n    RK\nRuckman\nMidfield\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can probably make some assumptions about which players might be higher in say, goals than others. Forwards are more likely than defensive players to excel in those types of stats.\nAn Introduction to Basic Statistics in the AFL\nBefore looking at the statistics broken out by position it is important for us to define some of these terms to understand what each counting statistics refers to. I am only going to pick out a few basic statistics at the moment that show up on most AFL boxscores, but will delve deeper into other statistics at a later time. To start, let’s take a look at scoring and I think this image from rookie road. Does a great job of illustrating how scoring works.\n\n\nGoals: This is when a player kicks the ball between the two center goal post and it is NOT touched by another player or touches either goalpost.\nBehinds: A behind, worth 1 point, is scored when the ball passes between a goal post and a behind post at any height, or if the ball hits a goal post, or if any player sends the ball between the goal posts by touching it with any part of the body other than a foot. A behind is also awarded to the attacking team if the ball touches any part of an opposition player, including a foot, before passing between the goal posts\nMarks: A mark is a catch of the kicked ball which earns the catching player a free kick. The catch must be clearly taken and the umpire has to deem it to be a clean position. Marks can be some of the cooler plays from my perspective as someone new to the sport. The best way I can describe it in NFL terms is as if a run play magically turned into a punt which turned into a hail mary scenario with a jump ball between the target and defenders. You can mark the ball after:\n\nA pass is completed that is longer than 10 meters\nCatching it in the air without anyone else touching it\nCatch the ball without it hitting the ground.\n\nDisposals: This is really an legally made pass either by a kick or handpass. It is how you get rid of the ball. It can approximate possession.\n\nHandballs: Handball or handpass are disposals by hand. This is done by holding the ball in one hand and punching it with the other. It is a certain type of pass.\nKicks: Disposals by foot. Any kick type pass made by a player\n\nTackles: Pretty straight forward, but the number of tackles recorded\n\n\n\nPer Game Stats\n\nGoals Per Game\nThe graph paints a pretty self-explanatory and expected picture about which positions score more goals than others. Forward positions dominate the goal scoring with the full forward a full goal over the next highest position at 3.69 average goals per game. Scoring from a defenders position is an absolute rarity with the the half-back flanks averaging 0.28 goals a game, but full backs put up a paltry 0.07 goals per game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehinds Per Game\nBehinds are very similar to goals in how they are scored so we’d expect a strong correlation with goals. We can see that from a position standpoint, the story plays out the same as goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTackles Per Game\nTackles per game are led by the center midfield positions of Rover, Ruck Rover, and Center. While from an American perspective, one may have assumed the more defensive positions would lead in this state, it make sense having watched a few games how much of the hectic position play occurs in the midfield where teams are contesting for position. An attempted goal may take place 40 or 50 meters out meaning defenders may be playing much deeper and have less opportunities to make tackles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisposal Per Game\nDisposals are essentially “the pass” of the AFL and can be done either by hand (handballs) or foot (kicks) which I break out below. Once again, a majority your disposals come from those central midfield positions followed by some of the wing positions. Forwards tend to be much lower in these stats. This plays out similarly for handballs and kicks, though the position of Ruckman is quite interesting. we see Ruckman put out about 12 handballs per game, but come in the lowest for kicks at 14.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarks per Game\nThe position with the most marks on average in a game is Center Half Back with the Full Back and Half-Back Flanks on either side following behind Center Half Back. So a Mark is something it seems a defender does more often than other positions. That said, the distribution isn’t much difference from the max down to the min in terms of spread."

    "text": "I wouldn’t say that I am entirely new to sports analytics though the majority of the work I’ve done has been in private. I have a background in data science and at times have dabbled in building xG models for hockey, dug into nflfastR, participated in Kaggle competitions, and putting together an analytics based site for my family’s fantasy football team. So for my inaugural analytics post, naturally I am going to start with a sport that until last week I had never watched a single game of - Aussie Rules Football.\nI have a newborn and like most parents with exceptionally young children I find myself awake at particularly odd hours with a bottle in hand and nothing to do but tune into the TV. July is a bit of a dry month for sports in the US and I found myself flipping between a CFL game and an Aussie Rules Football (AFL) game. I was instantly and utterly hooked. The game was a fast paced mixture of rugby and soccer played on something that looked like a cricket pitch and was intuitive enough that I could pick up roughly the rules and scoring within the first half. It was a fast paced game with a decent amount of scoring and I immediately found myself daydreaming about what cool things could be done with player tracking data.\nFrom that Collingwood vs. Freemantle game in Round 18, I watched roughly a game a night for the next 4 to 5 nights and plan to watch any game on TV through the end of the season. What excites me to tackle this as one of the first analytics topics for this blog is that I am literally a week into this sport. Unlike American sports that I’ve grown up watching, playing, and intimately understanding the games, Aussie Rules is an entirely foreign sport to me and I get to approach the sport and the analytics side in parallel. I plan to learn the sport through the data as much as watching the games. For instance, I have no clue what the positions players are called and if certain positions score more than others. That is an excellent question to ask the data. How much is scoring a trait that a player carries from year to year? Do certain types of players record certain important statistics?\nEventually I plan to do more advanced work with what public AFL data is available. That said, the majority of my AFL posts will be not only be beginner level analytics, but ask seemingly novice level questions for those familiar with the sport. So I apologize to any AFL fan stumbling upon some of this work as it will appear overly simplistic. For American sports fans, hopefully this acts as a gateway into a sport that truly deserves more attention in America.\nThe next few posts in my AFL series will tackle some basic questions about the game as I educate myself on the basics. I plan to use the fitzRoy R package for a majority of this work so huge thanks to the author of that package, Jimmy Day, and those who provide the underlying data that package pulls. You can see further documentation on fitzRoy here. Also, a huge thanks to@crow_data_sci who provided some scripts that I will use in later work. He is a tremendous AFL twitter follow. I also recommend @AFLLab, @MatterOfStats @AFLGains and I am sure I will be gathering other useful AFL follows as I go. I use Wikipedia for the bulk of my understanding of the basic of the rules and the sports, but if I have something wrong please let me know. Please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter @cincysam6 if you notice something incorrect about my understanding of the game as I work through this work or if you have any useful resources that I might be able to take advantage of."

    "text": "Welcome to Fourth Line Analytics!\nI’ve thought about creating this blog for a couple of years now, but I always found it difficult to stay consistent with hobby work in sports analytics. After a full day of “data science-ing” at my day job, I found it hard to put my interest and curiosity in sports analytics into action. However, after participating in the NFL Big Data Bowl and getting Honorable Mention, and meeting a bunch of interesting sports analytics folks through the Cincinnati Sports Analytics Meetup, I decided to put some action behind these ideas. Thus, after many false starts I’ve finally decided to create a public site to capture my sports analytics work, book notes, tutorials, etc. on data science, sports analytics, and maybe the odd musing or two. My primary objective with this blog is mainly to capture the work I’ve done keep my notes in a consistent spot. Therefore, some of the posts may not be entirely targeted towards a public audience, but instead for my own benefit.\nI plan for this to be a general purpose blog with analytics work broken out by sport. In addition to my own work, I want to capture notes and thoughts on any books, articles and podcasts related to Sports Analytics.\nThe name of this blog, the fourth line, comes from the 4th line in hockey which tend to be the low skilled grinders who make the team for their hustle and grit. Nothing I put out on this blog will likely be on the bleeding edge in sports analytics, but I hope if you stumble across this portfolio of work you find at least one interesting nugget or two.\nPlease feel free to reach out on twitter or via e-mail at Samuelckirschner@gmail.com."
